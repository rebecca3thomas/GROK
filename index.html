					<h1>WHAT IS GROK?</h1>
					<p>GROK is an event unlike any other. It's a gathering of creative people who want to connect with their peers and discuss the most pressing issues of our day.</p>
					<p>It's a call for everyone who is tired of events where passive attendees sit for hours at a time and listen to speakers on stage. GROK is an event for active learning and sharing and where every voice truly matters.</p>
					<p>Instead of listening to speakers, GROK is built around group discussions called 10/20s.</p>
					<h1>WHAT ARE 10/20s?</h1>
					<p>10/20s are mediated discussions between about a dozen participants. Any participant in a 10/20 can propose a topic for discussion. You can talk about software, your work environment, your personal challenges - anything that's on your mind.</p>
					<p>After 10 minutes of conversation, the session leader can choose to close the topic and ask for another. If the conversation is particularly interesting, the session leader can extend the clock for another 10 minutes, hence the name, "10/20s."</p>

					<h4>Moldover</h4>
					<h5>Musician</h5>
					<p>If technology and music are your life, brace yourself- MOLDOVER is about to reformat your soul. Hailed by over 1,000,000 YouTube viewers as "The Godfather of Controllerism", Moldover is a new breed of music icon. Combining the charisma of a rock star, the mad genius of a basement inventor, and the radical inclusiveness of the DIY internet generation, Moldover is "literally throwing away the rule book and reinventing the wheel" (Remix Magazine). Witness his balls-to-the-wall LIVE SHOW at a club, experience one of his JAMBOX multiplayer instruments at a festival, or pick up and play the "LIGHT THEREMIN" packaging of his debut album and understand why the next paradigm for music is a one-man-brand called Moldover.</p>
